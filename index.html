    <h1> WELCOME TO MY PAGE </h1>
    <p>This page aims to be a tool if some people out there are willing to know other people and want to make
        interesting conversation with someone but feeling ashamed to start that interactive topic. For all of us let
        open some information about ourself by creating My Profile page for them who want to swim stalking about us.
    </p>
    <h2>Say No to Boring Conversation, because you have known little bit about what I am interested in</h2>
    <h3>Let's get started</h3>
    <h4>As you, I do have some hobbies to do:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <p>I like to swim in my leisure time, actually not really swimming for working out, more like only playing
            water, because Im not a good swimmer </p>
        <li>Playing Table Tennis</li>
        <p>Actually, instead of saying this is as a hobby, I prefer to say I play it because only that sport I am little
            capable on, I couldn't find any sport I am good at, this tennis table is the only one left skill I used to
            know in my childhood</p>
        <li>Watching movies</li>
        <p>Wao waow waow, I can say watching korean dramas, the smooth one for my brain.You know my brain kind of lazy.
            Anyway I love to watch Sherlock Homes movies and series aswell, because everything in there far from my
            little brain to catch. </p>
    </ul>
